# General Meeting Challenges 2022-2023

Welcome to the Society of Software Engineers weekly coding challenge. This repository is responsible for providing students with
the opportunity to show their creative solutions to the challenge questions that will be revealed at the end of each general meeting.
These questions will consist in their own file directory and will have a test suite that will test students solutions to challenges.

## Structure

For the upcoming weeks we will have a directory that will be named under the academic week. within these directories there will be a list of unit tests
to test student submissions. if a students submission passes the entire test suite they are able to send the tech head their solutions to run and grant
a new membership.
