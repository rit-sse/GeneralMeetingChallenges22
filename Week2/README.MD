# Instructions to run

cd into the project directory

    cd /Week2

install all required dependencies

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Or if on Mac

    pip3 install -r requirements.txt

then to run the test suite

    python -m pytest

if you're on linux or mac

    python3 -m pytest

Don't worry about, the error message if it says Assertion Error that this is supposed to happen. This means you completed the setup and creation of the test suite, so now you can make changes to your version of the repo and test your solution. Good Luck!
