""" stairs.py is a file responsible for being the main runner for the stairs challenge.
    Students will be able to run this file against another suite of test case to see 
    if they had successfully finished the challenge. the challenge problem is here 

There's a staircase with N steps,
and you can climb 1 or 2 steps at a time.
Given N, 
write a function that returns the number of unique
ways you can climb the staircase. The order of the steps matters.
For example, if N is 4, then there are 5 unique ways:

    1, 1, 1, 1
    2, 1, 1
    1, 2, 1
    1, 1, 2
    2, 2

What if, 
instead of being able to climb 1 or 2 steps at a time, 
you could climb any number from a set of positive integers X?
For example, if X = {1, 3, 5}, you could climb 1, 3, or 5 steps at a time. 
Generalize your function to take in X.
